Just some git scripts which are quite handy

## Clean untracked files ##

Sometimes you end up with lots of untracked files that you really want to get 
rid of. Git features a small commandline command for that purpose called 'git clean'.

Remove all untracked files:

    git clean -f

Remove all untracked files and directories:

    git clean -f -d
